# 🚀 Interactive A* Pathfinding and Prim's Maze Generation  

An interactive **Python visualization tool** that demonstrates the **A* Pathfinding Algorithm** alongside **Prim's Maze Generation**. Built using **Pygame**, this project lets users dynamically place start, end, and wall points to visualize the A* algorithm in real-time.

## 🎯 Project Highlights  
- **Algorithm Focus** – Combines A* Pathfinding with **Prim’s Maze Generation**.  
- **Interactive GUI** – Allows users to create mazes and test pathfinding.  
- **Educational** – Designed to help understand pathfinding concepts through hands-on visualization.  
- **Minimal Dependencies** – Built using Python with **NumPy and Pygame**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Main language.  
- **Pygame** – GUI for visualization and interactive grid control.  
- **A* Algorithm** – Pathfinding algorithm for optimal shortest path calculation.  
- **Prim's Algorithm** – Randomized maze generation through minimum spanning trees.

## 🎮 How It Works  
1. **Maze Generation**:  
   - Press `P` to generate a random maze using **Prim's Algorithm**.  
   - Cells are carved out to form a randomized but solvable maze.  

2. **Pathfinding (A*)**:  
   - Click to place a **start** and **end point**.  
   - Walls can be manually added by clicking on cells.  
   - A* calculates the shortest path in real time as walls are updated.  

3. **Clear and Reset**:  
   - Press `C` to reset the grid and start over.
